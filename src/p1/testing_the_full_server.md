# Testing the Full Server

Sometimes you need to test how your entire server works together, including routing. The `httptest` package provides tools for testing complete HTTP servers without requiring an actual network connection.

## Setting up an httptest.Server and testing endpoints

The `httptest.Server` type creates a real HTTP server for testing purposes:

```go
{{#include ../../goexamples/example-gracefulshut/main_test.go}}}
```


## Benefits of Full Server Testing

Testing your complete server offers several advantages:

1. **Tests routing logic**: Verifies URL patterns and HTTP methods are correctly mapped
2. **Tests middleware integration**: Ensures middleware like authentication works properly
3. **Closer to real-world usage**: Tests the API as a client would use it
4. **Exposes integration issues**: Reveals problems that might not appear in isolated handler tests

By combining both handler-level testing and full server testing, you can build confidence in your API's correctness and reliability.

>A pragmatic approach is to use full server testing and that is my recommendation.
